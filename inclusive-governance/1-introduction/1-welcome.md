# Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Open Source

> "*Diversity is a number, inclusion is a process, equity is the outcome*" - Jess Mitchell

This quote is really important framing for diversity, equity and inclusion in open source. Take a moment to think about it - diversity is a **NUMBER**. While it's true that seeing an increase in number of those who have been historically unrepresented in open source can be a positive signal, it's not the end goal.  **The end goal is equity, and inclusion is the process to get there**. Open source governance needs inclusive processes to ensure equity across our projects and communities.

In the context of building inclusive communities, is an important reminder that equity requires that we all consider power dynamics when we're building governance, and especially the enforcement of a code of conduct.

This course will walk you through a brief history of DEI in open source, the standards and process to support inclusion in your community including examples of how they work in practice. This course comes with an activity to build Etiquette Guidelines for your community, which is a great community and team exercise. 

Throughout this course, and in the experience of acting on behalf of inclusion in your project or community it's important to be open to being wrong to embracing learning about the experiences of others as the path to trust.
