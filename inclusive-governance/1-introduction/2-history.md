# This isn't news

[Open Source has a diversity problem](https://www.wired.com/2017/06/diversity-open-source-even-worse-tech-overall/).  But this isn’t [news](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community).

For decades, actually.

 It’s simply not enough to count who makes it through the gauntlet of tasks and exclusive cultural norms that lead to a first pull request; it’s not enough to celebrate increased diversity if the experiences of those who are underrepresented don't feel safe, or lacking equity.

 If you take a look at this college of articles about diversity in open source, you can see one on the top left 'Women in Open Source - the Canary in the Coal Mine'... that article is from 2002.  Today, initiatives like [All In](https://github.com/AllInOpenSource/All-In) from GitHub, and community efforts like [Open Source Diversity](https://opensourcediversity.org/), are still tacking this same problem.  Twenty years later. 

 This is not news, and a perquisite of this course is that you already understand how critical diversity is for people, for innovation, for communities  - and that we have a long way to go.
