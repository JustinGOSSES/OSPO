# Intention is Nice But...

> "*Intention without strategy is chaos*"
- [Kim Crayton](https://www.kimcrayton.com/)

This is one of my favorite quotes, when describing why we need policy, process and standards for inclusion in open source. Intention is great! You're (hopefully) reading this because you have intention to do more, to do better and to be part of the evolution of open source into equitable experience for all - but without strategy what does that look like?  It's probably going to be a bit chaotic and even random.

**Open is not the same as inclusive.**


# Meritocracy and the myth of open
The open source story, is actually one filled with intention - intention that by saying a project is 'open' everyone is welcome, everyone can contribute and everyone can be successful, which we know hasn't been how its played out.  In large part, this is also a result meritocratic governance being primary and dominant approach to governance for well over a decade.

Mitchell Baker of the Mozilla project summarizes they removed meritocracy from their governance page:

> “Sometimes good words and good aspirations get tarnished with history, and need to be set aside. I personally aspire to many aspects of our work being a meritocracy. And the original meaning I took for meritocracy in open source meant empowering individuals, rather than managers, or manager’s managers or tenure-based authority. I still long to develop these things.

> However, it’s now clear that so-called meritocracies have included effective forms of discrimination. 
This might be hidden bias, where some aspect of identity causes a person’s contributions to be routinely devalued. 
It might be over discrimination or harassment. 
It might be threats that minimize the contributions even offered. Whatever the cause, open source “meritocracies” suffer from these problems – open source projects tend to have less diversity than other software organizations.
> Fairly or not, the word “meritocracy” has come to signal systems where there is little effective restraint on perpetuating discrimination.
 It may even become a code-word for organizations that resist the need to build diverse and inclusive organizations.
> I personally long for a word that conveys a person’s ability to demonstrate competence and expertise and commitment separate from job title, or college degree, or management hierarchy, and to be evaluated fairly by one’s peers.
 I long for a word that makes it clear that each individual who shares our mission is welcome, and valued, and will get a fair deal at Mozilla – that they will be recognized and celebrated for their contributions without regard to other factors.
> Sadly, “meritocracy” is not that word. 
Maybe it once was, or could have been. But not today. 

In the next module, we'll review ways we're being strategic about inclusion in open source.
