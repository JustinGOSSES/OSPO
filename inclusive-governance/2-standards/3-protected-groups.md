# Protected Groups

At the top of our Code of Conduct you'll see 'Our Pledge', which then lists what we call 'protected groups', or 'supported groups'.  These groups are those we know have historically been excluded, made invisible or harmed in open source.  Providing this list signals an accountability for the experiences the most vulnerable and margenlized groups in our communities, and accountability to ourselves for reaching that equitable outcome.

This is really important to grasp. Once again,  this is not an exhaustive of everyone who can possibly participate. It instead, prioritizes the experiences of those who without such governance and enforcement would be at risk.  This is getting us closer to making 'open' actually 'inclusive'.
