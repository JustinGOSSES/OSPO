# What are Etiquette Guidelines and How are they Different?

> Etiquette Guidelines are best practices or guard rails customized to your project's ways of working.

Etiquette Guidelines (also sometimes called Participation Guidelines) are a way to extend the values, and purpose of the Code of Conduct into the context of daily interactions in your project.   It does not replace the Code of Conduct, but rather compliments it - and helps explain to your project and community the way in which it applies to your project.   It isn't necessary to have Etiquette Guidelines, but it is highly recommended not for the value of the document itself, but because creating one is a helpful exercise for community alignment around inclusion.

Etiquette Guidelines can be crafted to describe inclusive interactions in:
- Forums and chat channels
- Issues and Pull Requests
- Meetings, meetups and other in-person events
