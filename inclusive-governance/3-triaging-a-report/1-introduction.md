# Taking and Giving a Report

[TODO PHOTO]

The heart of our workplace and communities, whether online or in-person  - are the people.   In this module you'll learn some of the best practices for taking and giving a report in a way that prioritizes the safety and wellbeing of those involved.

## When to Report

Please report all incidents where someone has engaged in behavior which violates Microsoft's Code of Conduct, and **which you are not able to personally resolve**. This includes activities that make you, or someone else feel unsafe, unwelcome or uncomfortable.   If you are not sure if a behavior is a violation, it's still OK to report.

## Taking a Report

If someone reports to you, in either written or verbal terms, make space for pauses in their story.  As much as possible, practice active listening - that is to absorb not only the words that are being said, but also the feelings that are being conveyed and any related context. These details can help you, and others supporting the process understand the situation and will better inform the next-steps.  Additionally:
* Do not question or judge their experience
* Do not promise any particular response or outcome.
* If they have questions about the code of conduct process send them to our [FAQ page](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/).
* Do try to capture any digital assets (screenshots, text chats) that demonstrate the incident.

## Data Privacy

If you are documenting a report your first focus will be on the person, or people reporting.  However, ensuring participants are protected goes beyond the process responsiveness. Because someone may share personal or sensitive information about themselves or others, by default, all incident notes should be labeled as **Highly Confidential**, and be limited in access to only yourself.  Access to this document may change on a case-by-case basis as stakeholders are identified, and only for individual emails (not group alias where membership can change).  As needs-to-know access changes, access should also be removed.  Please familiarize yourself with your organizations data privacy, and email classification labels.
