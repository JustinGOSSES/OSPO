# Enforcement Action

Deciding on enforcement action can sometimes be easy. If someone has caused harm, or in some way been found to have violated a code of conduct in the way described in the triage chart as **P1**, banning them or asking them to step back for a period of time feels like a pretty easy decision to arrive at. Not always, but usually.

Similarly if someone has violated the CoC in a way that they might not have realized impacted another person, and where that impact was low like a **P3**, issuing a warning feels easy enough to arrive at as a first decision.

However, incidents in communities are as unique as the people in them and thus consequences may also need to vary. Generally, thinking of enforcement as being a ladder of possibilities is helpful. It's not prescriptive, rather it's a way to think about escalation and seriousness.

There are four areas of risk that we think about in CoC enforcement:

* **Safety** -- Physical, sexual, and psychological safety for all involved.
* **Privacy** -- Privacy, confidentiality, and security of people's data related to reports.
* **Legal** -- Failure to recognize applicable law, or follow required processes, resulting in potential legal liability. This includes the geographic region where reporter & reported individuals reside.
* **Brand** -- Mishandling, or not handling, can create mistrust in organizations and narratives beyond their ability to manage.

Next, we'll look at some examples of P1, P2, P3, and P4 incidents, as a way to help you start thinking about how this might work equitably in your project.
