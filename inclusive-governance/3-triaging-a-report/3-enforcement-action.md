# Enforcement Action

Deciding on enforcement action can be very, very easy.  If someone has caused harm, or in some way been found to have violated a code of conduct in the way described in the triage chart as **P1** - banning those people, or asking them to step back for a period of time feels like a pretty easy decision to arrive at. 

Similarly if someone has violated the CoC in a way that they might not have realized impacted another person, and where that impact was low like a **P1** - issuing a warning feels easy enough to arrive at as a decision.

However, incidents in communities are as unique as the people in them and thus consequences may also need to vary.  Generally, thinking of enforcement as being a ladder of possibilities is helpful. It's not prescriptive, rather it's a way to think about escalation and seriousness.   

As mentioned in the introduction **equity and trust** must exist, and must be something you strive for as you consider consequences.

In the next couple of pages, we'll look at some examples of types of incidents as examples to learn from.
