# P1 Report: This report is urgent -- drop everything else

![p1](../images/p1.jpeg)

*NOTE: These are all examples of the types of incidents that can occur in an open source community, and not based on any specific events or incidents and do not come with prescriptive resolutions. Rather, these are intended to help you practice thinking about the context, capacity, and scope of incidents.*

**For cases of this urgency, it's important to work with HR, legal, policy, and other stakeholders as much as possible while prioritizing the privacy and safety of individuals.**

**Example Scenario 1**: A well-known and liked contributor to your project, after an absence for unknown reasons, returns to your project with a noticeably different tone. They are impatient with maintainers and being very short in responses to comments on their PRs. It's challenging for the maintainer to understand the behaviors and they try to be patient waiting for this person's usual behavior to return. For reasons that aren't clear, this contributor begins to include personal information in their complaints.

> "Didn't you see my comment? Your reasons for not accepting this PR make NO SENSE"

> "You obviously don't care about me, or my mental health"

> "It seems like you just want to get rid of me, which takes away my whole purpose for living"

> "You would probably be happy if I was dead"

Usually, we think of P1 (urgent, stop everything) issues as someone threatening others, but threats of self-harm are no less important. In such a situation, it's very hard to know what to do, and regional and local support for mental health services vary. Issuing a warning or ban would be unlikely to stop the behaviors and perhaps further impact both the community and this individual. It's important to work with your legal, HR, and safety experts to decide on which steps will result in the least likely path for harm

**Example Scenario 2**: A person known to your project posts pornographic material in a chat channel used by many community members, but not an official channel for your project. Community members reach out to you or someone on your project to report this as a violation of your CoC.

While it may be tempting to dismiss anything that happens outside of your project as being "out of your control," the impact on your community is the same. [Microsoft's code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) includes a line to make clear:

> This Code of Conduct also applies to actions taken outside of these spaces, and which have a negative impact on community health.

As this is a clear P1 violation, and bold attempt to intimidate, humiliate, and upset individuals in the community, the consequence ladder can be helpful.

**Example Scenario 3**: Someone at a community event reaches out to you to report that another community member has made racist and sexist comments towards them.

Events should, and usually do, have their own local code of conduct processes and enforcement, to redirect people to services, and are set up to respond quickly and in the location of the violation. 

That said, you need to have some idea of the outcome of that process, and as much as possible, work to understand the outcome for decision-making in online spaces. For example, if a person was banned from a community event it's likely they should be banned from digital spaces as well.
