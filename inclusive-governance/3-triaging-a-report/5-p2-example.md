# P2 Report: This report is serious and should be handled as a priority

![p2](../images/p2.jpeg)

*NOTE: These are all examples of the types of incidents that can occur in an open source community, and not based on any specific events or incidents and do not come with prescriptive resolutions. Rather, these are intended to help you practice thinking about the context, capacity, and scope of incidents.*

**For cases of this urgency, it's important to work with HR, legal, policy, and other stakeholders as much as possible while prioritizing the privacy and safety of individuals.**

**Example Scenario 1**: At a community member hackathon, it's noted that people of the primary demographic have taken all coding/development work and assigned non-technical and design work to underrepresented people who have specifically signed up for technical contribution. Two of those people leave, but the third uses the code of conduct to report their experience of being excluded, based on their belief it is due to their background. 

**Always trust the experiences of people who are brave enough to share them.** It might be your default to think "I am sure they didn't mean it" or "maybe the reporter misunderstood that this person wanted to do technical work," but what you should know is that this person is an expert in their experience. A case like this really depends on who is involved: Do the folks excluding others have a history of that behavior? Does the person reporting actually want to remain with the project if the situation is corrected? They might be very upset and are using the report to make sure that in the future, the same thing doesn't happen for others (and you should welcome that chance). Take time to listen to the person reporting, ask what they would like to see as an outcome, and move to resolve accordingly. If there are people working on behalf of a company, use their HR processes to report as well.

**Example Scenario 2**: One of your colleagues (working on open source) is expecting a new baby and has privately shared this with a community member they trust. During a pull request review involving both of these community members, there is a brief but strong disagreement about the pull request, where this person blurts out "maybe you have baby brain" (or similar language that reveals the pregnancy to everyone reading the pull request).

**Privacy and security online is deeply tied to people's ability to control information about themselves that may result in targeting or decisions about our capabilities that are, among other things, sexist or discriminatory against their physical state.** This is why some people limit what their profiles say about their gender identity, age, ethnicity, or even geographic location. Revealing information not already shared publicly by the individual exposes them to potential harm and also to judgment that results in lost opportunity. This person may not have shared their pregnancy status with a boss, family member, and so forth, so it's important to consult your colleague about how they would like to handle the issue, or use HR processes. 

Deciding to use someone's pregnancy status and private information against them to win an argument, warrants serious consequences.
