# P3 Report: This report does not require immediate action.

**NOTE:** *These are all examples based on the types of incidents which can occur in an open source community, and not based on any specific events or incidents and do not come with prescriptive resolutions. Rather, these are intended to help you practice thinking about the context, capacity and scope of incidents.*

**Example Scenario 1**: A maintainer, or community leader on a project has been reported to you as someone who they feel is gatekeeping. On review of submitted comments, issues you can see that while the maintainer is being very dismissive of certain contributions, and contributors even going so far as to insult the contribution.

> 'You can't be serious, this is garbage!'

> 'Maybe go learn to code first, and then come back, we don't need toddler contributions here'

>  Closes issues or PRs without comment.

> 'I can't understand you'

This does look like gatekeeping because, they are not giving useful feedback, their tone is toxic, they are not attempting to create equity by trying to understand and learn -  and is likely to completely discourage contributions from that same person, or others who may have standing in the community, or who are underrepresented in the community.  There are also enough examples to show a trend.

**In this case if this maintainer is employed by a company to maintain a project, it would be appropriate to research the policy for reporting employees**.  Those HR processes won't specifically mention the open source code of conduct, but that connection can be made during the report.  The benefit of looping in HR processes is that the community leadership is  responsible for the decision, and are less likely to be retaliated against by that person.

**If this person is a community leader (not paid for the role), then the community process would need to address**.  In cases where you deal with someone who has existed, and been unchallenged for their behaviors for a duration of time can be tough, in that this person is unlikely to agree with the assessment in the short term.  On the enforcement ladder, sometimes a temporary ban is helpful to give people time and space to evaluate.  A temporary ban can also come with requirements that this person commit to the Code of Conduct in some visible way that creates trust for the community that should they return, things will be different. 

There's a whole range of scenarios where this person might be the only maintainer, or also the enforcer of the code of conduct that might result in consequences being unlikely. In this case the role of mobility (move elsewhere), or quite honestly - forking a project can be an option. In the context of software used by your company or organization, this is a conversation to bring to legality.

**Example Scenario 2**: A person has been opening issues after issue about a feature or update that your product has made in recent weeks that they strongly disagree with. As a maintainer, or community leader, you have done your best to address their concerns, and even to consult internal stakeholders with that feedback to double-check the product roadmap and position.  You have indicated to this person the reasons for he updates/changes, and yet they repeat the same challenges - unwilling, it seems to accept the decision and feedback.  This person then begins emailing people at the organization, including your CEO. While not specifically a violation of the code of conduct, it is absolutely **disruptive behavior**.

These kind of toxic situations aren't articulated well in Codes of Conduct (but related behaviors can be covered in participation guidelines/etiquette guidelines), and really what you become up against is mitigating risk that these behaviors disrupt the sense of harmony and safety in your project community.  This is where the ladder can be useful.  Sending a warning to this person, letting them know that continued behavior will not be tolerated is both an opportunity for this person to step back, and a way to communicate that escalations in consequence will be the next step. Should their behaviors continue, they should trust that so too will the consequences.  To ban someone from community systems can be challenging - especially if they create duplicate accounts to replaced banned accounts, working as much with TOC violations of platforms you're working on will be helpful.
