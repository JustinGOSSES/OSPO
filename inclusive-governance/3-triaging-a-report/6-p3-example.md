# P3 Report: This report does not require immediate action.

![p3](../images/p3.jpeg)

*NOTE: These are all examples of the types of incidents that can occur in an open source community, and not based on any specific events or incidents and do not come with prescriptive resolutions. Rather, these are intended to help you practice thinking about the context, capacity, and scope of incidents.*

**Example Scenario 1**: A maintainer on a project has been reported to you as someone who the reporter feels is gatekeeping. On review of submitted pull request comments and issues, you can see that the maintainer is being very dismissive of certain contributions and contributors, even going so far as to insult the contribution.

> "You can't be serious, this is garbage!"

> Maybe go learn to code first, and then come back, we don't need toddler contributions here."

> Closes issues or PRs without comment.

> "I can't understand you."

This does look like gatekeeping because, they are not giving useful feedback, their tone is toxic, and they are not attempting to create equity by trying to understand and learn. That kind of behavior is likely to discourage contributions from that person, others who may have standing in the community, and others who are underrepresented in the community. There are also enough examples to show a trend.

**In this case if this maintainer is employed by a company to maintain a project, it would be appropriate to research the policy for reporting employees.** Those HR processes won't specifically mention the open source code of conduct, but that connection can be made during the report. The benefit of looping in HR processes is that the community leadership is responsible for the decision and are less likely to be retaliated against by that person.

**If this person is a maintainer who's not paid for performing that role, then the community process would need to address the behaviors.** It can be tough to deal with someone who has long been a member of the community and been unchallenged for their behaviors for that time; they're unlikely to agree with the assessment in the short term. On the enforcement ladder, sometimes a temporary ban is helpful to give people time and space to evaluate. A temporary ban can also come with requirements that this person commit to the Code of Conduct in some visible way that creates trust for the community, such that should they return, things will be different.

There's a whole range of scenarios where this person might be the only maintainer or the enforcer of the code of conduct that might result in consequences being unlikely. In this case the role of mobility (move elsewhere), or quite honestly, forking a project can be an option. In the context of software used by your company or organization, this is a conversation to bring to legal.

**Example Scenario 2**: A person keeps opening issues about a feature or update your product has made in recent weeks that they strongly disagree with. As a maintainer or community leader, you have done your best to address their concerns, even consulting internal stakeholders with that feedback to double-check the product roadmap and position. You have indicated to this person the reasons for the updates/changes, yet they repeat the same objections, unwilling, it seems to accept the decision and feedback. This person then begins emailing people at the organization, including your CEO. While not specifically a violation of the code of conduct, it is absolutely **disruptive behavior**.

These kind of toxic situations aren't articulated well in Codes of Conduct, but related behaviors can be covered in participation guidelines/etiquette guidelines. Really what you come up against is mitigating risk that these behaviors disrupt the sense of harmony and safety in your project community. This is where the ladder can be useful. Sending a warning to this person, letting them know that continued behavior will not be tolerated, is both an opportunity for this person to step back and a way to communicate that escalations in consequence will be the next step. Should their behaviors continue, they should trust that so too will the consequences. To ban someone from community systems can be challenging, especially if they create duplicate accounts to replace banned accounts. Working with the platforms you use to report terms of service violations will be helpful.
