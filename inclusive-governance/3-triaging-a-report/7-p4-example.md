**NOTE:** *These are all examples based on the types of incidents which can occur in an open source community, and not based on any specific events or incidents and do not come with prescriptive resolutions. Rather, these are intended to help you practice thinking about the context, capacity and scope of incidents.*

**Example Scenario 1**: You receive a report that a channel dedicated to your open source project, but not run by any of the project team has issues related to who 'gets admin rights' to run that channel.

While its true that actions happening outside of the project space, that have impact on the community should be addressed if they cause harm, or any violation of a code of conduct, it is not the role the team to manage disputes over things like ownership, channel admin access etc. It might be helpful to note how that dispute disrupts or impacts efforts to create equality among peers, but consequences related to a code of conduct are rarely helpful in situations like this.
