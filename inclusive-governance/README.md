# Mapping Your Open Source Career

## Description
This course provides a high level overview of inclusive open governance in open source, and the standards at Microsoft which support equitable outcomes in open collaboration.

# Learning Goals

**By the end of this course learners will be able to:**

* Articulate the history of open source, and why lack of intention and strategy has led to exclusion and harm of underrepresented and marginalized groups.
* Understand that equity and trust are prequisite to enforcement.
* Find clarity and trust around what support, resources and tools exist at Microsoft to ensure your success.
* Describe the difference between a Code of Conduct and Etiquette Guidelines, as well as the purpose of each.
* Describe basic steps in taking and handling a report, including those that prioritize the safety and privacy of individuals and organizations.
* Create a first-draft of your very own Etiquette Guidelines.


# Format

As outlined in the main README.md, this course is structured into modules with files within prefixed by number to indicate order.   Depending on your LMS experience these can easily be pulled into something like Jekyll or Hugo or cut and paste into Moodle (etc).

# Notes

**This course makes an assumption that the learner already understands why inclusion matters and wants to consider how they can use their power within the system to listen to, and create equity for those most vulnerable. It is a prerequisite.**
