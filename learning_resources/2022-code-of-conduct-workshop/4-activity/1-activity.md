# Activity

As mentioned, creating Etiquette Guidelines can be very helpful in encouraging the inclusive behaviors, and being clear about which which within the context of your specific community channels, forums and issue tracker are appropriate and expected.

Below you'll find a worksheet to help you, and your team brainstorm your Etiquette Guidelines. It asks:

* **Who will be participating in your project?** Some example answers might be 'staff engineers', 'contributing engineers', 'technical writers', and 'program managers'.
* **What tools will you use, and how will people use that tool to collaborate?**: Some answers might be 'GitHub (issues, PRs, Discussions)', or 'Slack(post a question, respond to a question)'.

**And then for each:**

* **Actions to encourage**: Some examples might be 'read the code of conduct', 'read the documentation before opening an issue', be 'patient waiting for maintainer responses', 'be respectful if you disagree'.
* **Actions to discourage**: Some examples might be 'don't use ALL CAPS', 'use mentions sparingly', 'don't comment on people's appearance', 'avoid technical jargon'.

From here you can begin go build out your guidelines.  We recommend that you do this as a group activity, to align with others in the community where ultimately the responsibility to lead by example lives.
