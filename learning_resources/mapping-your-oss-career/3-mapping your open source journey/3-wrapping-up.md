Congratulations! You have taken the important first steps needed to ensure that your open source activities, be that as part of your role, or in your personal time align with your goals and vision for success!   

It's important to bring what you've learned through activities in this course, to your manager and even team discussions.  The more you communicate the value of open source, the more others will begin to ask the right questions about where OSS strategy fits into their goals. Ultimately the ecosystem, and our customers benefit. Win, win and win.
