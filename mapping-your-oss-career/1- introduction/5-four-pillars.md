# Four Pillars of Open Source

At Microsoft, when we talk about open soruce software ("OSS") we do so under the following four pillars:

* **Use**: Using open source at Microsoft is encouraged. Building on the efforts of others allows us to create meaningful value for our customers to faster and engage with new ecosystems and user-bases in a natural way.  Use requires adherence to legal, license and other compliance criteria. 
* **Release**: Microsoft encourages you to release code as an open source project whenever it makes sense for your business, and provided you have goals for working in the open. 
* **Contribute**: Contributing back to the projects we track as a key element of the open source process.  We encourage everyone to contribute back to projects we use. 
* **Grow**: Where goals are aligned, Microsoft encourages projects to grow and evolve projects in the ecosystem of contributors, users and collaborators of which you are a part.  


> * COURSE NOTE: Each of these bullets should link to internal documentation for compliance and policy for each.
