While this course does not cover InnerSource, it's important to understand the differences between open source and InnerSource. We often use similar language to describe these collaborations, and its easy to forget there are important differences. 

InnerSource is the collaboration between teams **inside an organization** on projects and products that are not publicly available.  

Open Source is a collaboration with those **external to the organization** on software that licensed open source.  Note that just putting code on GitHub does not make it open source, it's the license that does that.
