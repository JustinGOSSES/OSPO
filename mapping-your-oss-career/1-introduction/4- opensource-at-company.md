# Open Source at Microsoft

![oss-at-microsoft](../images/main.jpg)

 Microsoft  helps maintain open source projects like [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [PowerToys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) and [ClearlyDefined](https://clearlydefined.io/?sort=releaseDate&sortDesc=true). You can find a longer list on the opensource.microsoft.com website under ['Projects'](https://opensource.microsoft.com/projects/).

Beyond building and use of open source, Microsoft is invested in nurturing and funding the broader ecosystem of which we are a part including our investment in the [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/), [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/), [OpenJS](https://openjsf.org/), [OpenInfra](https://openinfra.dev/) and more.  

To support open source projects we use, and to fund diversity, equity and inclusion we also run a monthly [FOSS Fund](https://github.com/microsoft/foss-fund/blob/main/README.md), to have further impact only those employees who have contributed to open source in the last two months, may vote.
