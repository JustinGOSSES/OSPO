# Open Source at Microsoft

We have built over 60K unique open source components using over 9.5 million more in our products. As part of their  communities, Microsoft also helps run open source projects like [.NET, TypeScript, PowerToys and ClearlyDefined]. You can find a longer list on the opensource.microsoft.com website under ['Projects'](https://opensource.microsoft.com/projects/).

Beyond building and use of open source, Microsoft is invested in nurturing and funding the broader ecosystem of which we are a part including our investment in the [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/), [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/), [OpenJS](https://openjsf.org/), [OpenInfra](https://openinfra.dev/) and more.  We also run a monthly [FOSS Fund](https://github.com/microsoft/foss-fund/blob/main/README.md), with goals to both fund open source projects, and encourage employees to contribute to upstream and other external projects.
