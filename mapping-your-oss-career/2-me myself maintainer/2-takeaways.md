# The Pathway to Open Source Leadership

In addition to code development, the first responsibilities of a new open source maintainer is a focus on responsiveness**: to issues, pull requests and user feedback. 

As a project grows the role requires has added responsibilities to ensure that that developer documentation is up-to-date, code of conduct is enforced and that decision[^1] making is transparent and inclusive of community.  

> Roles of influence like the maintainer role, requires strong collaboration skills and a focus on enabling the success of others.  There are many who contribute non-technical skills including documentation, testing, translation, running events and publishing their experiences on social media - the success of each, is  as critical to success as the code itself.

As Nell and Johannes' stories demonstrate, the role of maintainer represents excellence in engineering and community development.  These are highly sought-after skills in the ecosystem, and we hope you're feeling inspired!
