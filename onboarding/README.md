# Onboarding to Open Source at Microsoft 101

## Description
There's a lot of information to process when joining Microsoft, starting in Open Source, or both! With this in mind, the Open Source Programs Office has created an easy-to-navigate GitHub project board: "Onboarding to Open Source at Microsoft.".

This project groups activities in a way that allows people to connect with the open source community at Microsoft, gradually and at a manageable pace. From the board they can track their progress as they learn about tools, processes, and policy and complete foundational training for releasing, contributing to and using open source. This also works as a great tool for manager and Connect discussions.

A personalized version of this project board can be created with the simple click of a button by visiting [LINK].

**NOTE**: the open source version of the project board 'generator' is not yet available. In the meantime we have both an example board you can copy, or checklist for easier reference.
