The load generator is a console application that targets one or more elastic database instances in an Elastic Pool with a specific write load. You can run multiple instances of the load generator with different settings if you want to create a blended load, e.g., a mix of heavy a light load.

RSL is the Azure Paxos implementation which is used by multiple products in Azure and Bing. It provides the traditional Paxos functionality in a real world implementation. RSL includes support for dynamic replica set reconfiguration, including dynamic growth/srinking of the cluster, and also service-healing (replica replacement). RSL automates the durability of the state (by means of both durable journal files, and periodic snapshots). RSL allows multi-rings per process, allowing a single process to be part of multiple rings at the same time. RSL is implemented in C/C++ and provides a C# wrapper that naturally integrates with C# applications. RSL is widely used in Azure for a large number of infrastructure components, ranging from Azure Fabric Controller, to Azure Storage.","","452","4","true","true","true","false","11","MIT","C++"

To understand what this may mean, researchers have voiced a continuous desire to study how people currently converse with search engines. Traditionally, the desire to produce such a comprehensive dataset has been limited because those who have this data (Search Engines) have a responsibility to their users to maintain their privacy and cannot share the data publicly in a way that upholds the trusts users have in the Search Engines. Given these two powerful forces we believe we have a dataset and paradigm that meets both sets of needs: A artificial public dataset that approximates the true data and an ability to evaluate model performance on the real user behavior. What this means is we released a public dataset which is generated by creating artificial sessions using embedding similarity and will test on the original data. To say this again: we are not releasing any private user data but are releasing what we believe to be a good representation of true user interactions.","https://microsoft.github.io/MSMARCO-Conversational-Search/","18","0","true","true","true","true","12","MIT","Python"

An effective keyphrase extraction (KPE) system can benefit a wide range of natural language processing and information retrieval tasks. Recent neural methods formulate the task as a document-to-keyphrase sequence-to-sequence task. These seq2seq learning models have shown promising results compared to previous KPE systems The recent progress in neural KPE is mostly observed in documents originating from the scientific domain. In real-world scenarios, most potential applications of KPE deal with diverse documents originating from sparse sources. These documents are unlikely to include the structure, prose and be as well written as scientific papers. They often include a much diverse document structure and reside in various domains whose contents target much wider audiences than scientists. To encourage the research community to develop a powerful neural model with key phrase extraction on open domains we have created OpenKP: a dataset of over 150,000 documents with the most relevant keyphrases generated by expert annotation.","https://microsoft.github.io/OpenKP/","3866","5","true","true","true","true","17","MIT","Python"

The previous works conduct object detection and tracking with two separate models so they are very slow. In contrast, we propose a one-stage solution which does detection and tracking with a single network by elegantly solving the alignment problem. The resulting approach achieves groundbreaking results in terms of both accuracy and speed: (1) it ranks first among all the trackers on the MOT challenges; (2) it is significantly faster than the previous state-of-the-arts. In addition, it scales gracefully to handle a large number of objects. ","","44545","14","true","true","true","false","12","MIT","Python"

The solution consists of a Front End HTTP trigger, a Logic App Workflow, Azure Automation Account/Runbooks, Blueprints, and CosmosDB. The front end passes variables to the Logic App workflow URI via HTTP Post, details are covered in a dedicated section below. Currently, a sample static web front end is defined as an option in this project. Since the solution leverages a RESTful HTTP trigger, you can bring your own front end such as a PowerApp or a Github Action. The Logic App then takes the variables and passes them as parameters when invoking a set of Azure Automation Runbooks. The first runbook called create-mgmt-group creates a management group (if it already does not exist) to place the subscriptions under. The second runbook called create-subscription creates the subscriptions and places them under the previously created management group. The last runbook called assign-blueprintassigns the desired blueprint to the newly created subscriptions. This helps to ensure that proper policy and governance is enforced on new subscriptions at the time of build","","8036","12","true","true","true","false","9","MIT","PowerShell"

Motion capture is performed using a single depth sensor, such as Azure Kinect or Windows Kinect V2. Our toolbox enables real-time animation of the user's avatar by converting the transformations between systems that have different joints and hierarchies. Additional features of the toolbox include recording, playback and looping animations, as well as basic audio lip sync, blinking and resizing of avatars. Our main contribution is both in the creation of this open source tool as well as the integration of MoveBox with Kinect V2 and Azure Kinect, as well as the interfacing with the Microsoft Rocketbox avatars.","","1082931","5","true","true","true","false","11","MIT","C#"

Built with Sharepoint New Employee Onboarding solution as a backend with deep integration in Teams, NEO app makes it super easy for learning teams/ Human resources to manage relevant content and process for new employees using sharepoint lists. HR teams can also configure the time for an employee to be a new hire ex. 90 days and the app will stop notifying the new hires after that window.  The new hire checklist is integrated into the NEO Teams app and is used to guide the new hire through the onboarding journey. The checklist can be corporate or departmental. Additionally, new hires can also introduce themselves using the app by sharing an introduction which is automatically shared with their managers. This automation makes it easier for managers to review introductions about all new hires and share them with the relevant teams in one shot!   At any time, new employees can share feedback on a task in their onboarding journey or on the overall experience using a helpful bot command. All feedback is shared with HR team through helpful notifications and can be downloaded. Moreover, HR teams can also use the app to share pulse surveys for new employees at a configurable frequency.","","661","18","true","true","true","false","16","MIT","C#"

To address these challenges, we design and develop FOST and aims to empower engineers and data scientists to build high-accuracy and easy-usability forecasting tools.","","281","6","true","true","true","false","9","MIT","Python"
